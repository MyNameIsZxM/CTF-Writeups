## Performance

Our team managed to reach more than 1000 points! That's a new record for me. :+1:

It's crazy how when I gave up, the team was at rank 70-ish and when I came back to check it was already down to 300-ish :skull::skull::skull:

## Opinion for the event
- So many challenges for each category :heart_eyes: </br>
- No OSINT which was a bummer :no_mouth: </br>
- Although I only worked on it for like 7 hours, I managed to rack up 1050 points solo and then my friend Bannoob24 decided to help (srsly, thanks!)

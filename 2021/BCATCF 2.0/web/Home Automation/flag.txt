1. got nothing from inspect element.
2. when i try to turn off the light, the web gives a feedback "You must be admin to turn off the lights. Currently you are "vampire"."
3. usually something about admin involves cookies
4. i used a plugin called EditThisCookie to well... the name says it all lol.
5. turns out i was correct. there was a cookie with the value "vampire"
6. i changed it to admin and boom. the flag showed up.

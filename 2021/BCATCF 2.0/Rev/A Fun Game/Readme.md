1. based on the hints, we need gameconqueror or cheatengine
2. run the program using mono Game.exe
3. select mono Game.exe in the processes inside gameconqueror
4. now type the correct letter so the value goes up by one
5. insert value 1 in gameconqueror
6. there should be thousands of "1" as their values
7. type the correct letter so the value is now 2
8. only 1 value has the value "2"
9. now change the value to 1000
10. type the correct letter. the flag will be outputted

this reminds me when i was a kid and messed with cheat engine. ah the nostalgia...
